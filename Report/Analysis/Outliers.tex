\chapter{Outliers}

We begin our analysis by plotting the purity vs orthodoxy and performing both a linear and locally weighted regression analysis in \vref{fig:purityOrthodoxyStreamOutliers}.

\section{With outliers}
\begin{figure}[H]
	\caption{A plot of purity vs orthodoxy with data points coloured based on stream.}
	\label{fig:purityOrthodoxyStreamOutliers}
	\graphimage[height=2.25in]{StreamPurityVsOrthodoxyOutliers}
	Here, the solid curve is the result of the locally weighted regression analysis, and the shaded area is the 95\% confidence interval for that analysis.
	The dashed line is the result of the linear regression.
\end{figure}

The linear regression has a positive slope, which proves the first hypothesis that purity and orthodoxy are positively correlated.

\section{Identifying outliers}
From the locally weighted regression analysis, it is clear that some points are extremely deviate.
We next create residual plots using both the linear model and the locally weighted regression model to search for outliers in \vref{fig:linearResidualOutliers} and \vref{fig:lowessResidualOutliers}.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\caption{A residual plot using the linear regression analysis method.}
	\label{fig:linearResidualOutliers}
	\graphimage{LinearResidualPlot}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]
	\caption{A residual plot using the locally weighted regression analysis method.}
	\label{fig:lowessResidualOutliers}
	\graphimage{LoessResidualPlot}
\end{figure}

We will eliminate any points with an absolute residual exceeding a certain value.

For the linear analysis, we exclude any points with an absolute residual above $0.76$.
These are respondents \#81, and \#111.
For the locally weighted analysis, we exclude any points with an absolute residual above $0.80$.
This is just respondent \#81.

So, respondents \#81 and \#111 are the only major outliers.
We will continue the rest of the analysis as if they did not do the survey at all.

\section{Outliers removed}
We once again plot orthodoxy vs purity by stream in \vref{fig:purityOrthodoxyStreamNoOutliers}, this time with the outliers removed.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\caption{A plot of purity vs orthodoxy with data points coloured based on stream. Outliers have been removed.}
	\label{fig:purityOrthodoxyStreamNoOutliers}
	\graphimage[height=2.25in]{StreamPurityVsOrthodoxyNoOutliers}
	Here, the solid curve is the result of the locally weighted regression analysis, and the shaded area is the 95\% confidence interval for that analysis.
	The dashed line is the result of the linear regression.
\end{figure}

From this, we can clearly see that the two outliers removed were significantly effecting the correlation, especially for the locally weighted regression analysis.
