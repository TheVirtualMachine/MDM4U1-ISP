\chapter{Conclusion}

\section{The sandwich topic}
While sandwich views may at first seem to be a frivolous topic, it has the unique property of being immensely fascinating.
This allowed us to conduct a survey with many questions, obtaining a high quantity of quality numerical data for analysis.

\section{Conclusions of our analysis}
We conclude that our first hypothesis is true, and our second is inconclusive.

\section{Further research}
Our data set provides the possibility for further research into trends between ethnicity and specific questions.
For example, it looks like the relationship between ethnicity a whether or not chicken foot is a sandwich ingredient may have some interesting trends.

\section{Improvements to the study}
To improve this study, we would try asking the questions about subjects in a different manner so we could collect more meaningful responses on it.

\subsection{Removing bias}
Because our survey was in part a convenience sample and also partially a voluntary sample, we introduced a few sources of bias into the study.
Our study has voluntary response bias, response bias, and sampling bias.
However, we believe that the large sample size counteracts the bias enough that we are confident in our general results.
If we were to repeat this study, a simple random sample would likely provide more accurate numbers for analysis.
