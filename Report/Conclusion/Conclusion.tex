\chapter{Conclusion}

\section{The sandwich topic}
While sandwich views may at first seem to be a frivolous topic, it has the unique property of being immensely fascinating.
This allowed us to conduct a survey with many questions, obtaining a high quantity of quality numerical data for analysis.

\section{Conclusions of our analysis}
We conclude that our first hypothesis is true, and our second is inconclusive.

\section{Further research}
Our data set provides the possibility for further research into trends between ethnicity and specific questions.
For example, it looks like the relationship between ethnicity a whether or not chicken foot is a sandwich ingredient may have some interesting trends.

\section{Improvements to the study}
To improve this study, we would try asking the questions about subjects in a different manner so we could collect more meaningful responses on it.

\subsection{Removing bias}
Because our survey was in part a convenience sample and also partially a voluntary sample, we introduced a fair degree of bias into the study.
This includes biases such as voluntary response bias and sampling bias.
We believe that the large sample size counteracts that to a large enough degree that we are confident in our general results.
However, a simple random sample would likely provide more accurate numbers for the exact $r$ and $r^2$ values for instance.
