\Vref{fig:streamOrthodoxyWhiskers} is inconclusive towards concluding if our our second hypothesis is true or false.
MaCS students have a slightly higher orthodoxy than most other groups, and gifted students have a lower orthodoxy.
However, the difference is very small.
Next we will look at the mean responses to try to reach a stronger result.

\section{Means}

\end{figure}
\Vref{fig:streamOrthodoxyMean} is also inconclusive towards concluding if our our second hypothesis is true or false.
The difference between groups is too small to call significant.
So, we do either do not have sufficient data to say if there is a correlation between academic stream and orthodoxy, or there is no correlation.

Our second hypothesis is inconclusive.
