	In this paper we set out to examine the sandwich views of students and teachers at William Lyon Mackenzie C.I.

	Our study consisted of a survey conducted in person with 140 participants. We asked participants basic demographic information about where they fit into the William Lyon Mackenzie Collegiate Institute community, and examined correlations between sandwich views and demographics.

	We propose the creation of a two-dimensional sandwich alignment chart, inspired by two-dimensional political axes. The sandwich alignment chart has a dimension for ``sandwich purity'', and ``sandwich orthodoxy''.

	We hypothesize that:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Sandwich purity and sandwich orthodoxy will be positively correlated.
		\item Students in the MaCS or Gifted program are more likely to have a low orthodoxy score.
	\end{itemize}
