\chapter{Terminology and definitions}

This chapter will explain any terminology and definitions we use throughout this paper.

\section{Question types}
\begin{description}
	\item[Demographic question] A demographic question is any of the non-food questions asked in our survey. These questions asked about participants demographics, in order to examine any correlations between demographics and sandwich views.
	\item[Food question] A food question is any question asked about sandwiches or their ingredients. We asked 43 food questions as a part of this study. Participants answered each question on a 0 to 10 scale. We purposely started the scale at 0 so as to make 5 exactly in the middle of the range of possible responses.
\end{description}

\section{Variables}
The demographic questions are our independent variables.
We mainly look at academic stream, grade, and race as our independent variables.

The food questions are used to calculate orthodoxy and purity, which are our dependent variables.

We also consider the correlation between our two dependent variables to gain a deeper understanding of how they relate.

\section{Population of interest}
Our population of interest is the population of both students and teachers at William Lyon Mackenzie C.I.
