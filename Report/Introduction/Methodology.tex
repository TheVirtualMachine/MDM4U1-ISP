\chapter{Methodology}

\section{Survey type}
We conducted our survey as mix of a stratified, voluntary, and random sample.
We surveyed roughly 10\% of the William Lyon Mackenzie population.
With a sample size this large, most bias should be eliminated.

Unfortunately, we failed to collect a perfectly stratified sample.
However, an analysis of the data shows that to be inconsequential.

We made manual changes to categorical data to correct for similar, blank, and inappropriate responses.
As part of this, we grouped ethnicity into the following 11 categories: Caucasian, Chinese, East Asian, Filipino, Jewish, Korean, Middle Eastern, Mixed, Other, South Asian, and Vietnamese.

\subsection*{Demographic questions}
For demographic information, we asked participants for their grade (with teacher as an option), favourite subjects, and ethnic background.
We asked students for their academic stream, and teachers for their department.

Since the number of teachers surveyed was small, we do not do any analysis on teachers departments, and instead treat them as a separate grade and academic stream.
We also do not analyze the data on favourite subjects since it is very noisy.

\subsection*{Food questions}
We asked respondents 43 questions related to sandwiches and their ingredients.
We use all of this data.
