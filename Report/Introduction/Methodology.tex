\chapter{Methodology}

\section{Survey type}
We conducted our survey as mix of a stratified, voluntary, and random sample.
We surveyed roughly 10\% of the William Lyon Mackenzie population.

Unfortunately, we failed to collect a perfectly stratified sample.
However, an analysis of the data shows that to be inconsequential.

We made manual corrections to categorical to correct for similar, blank, and inappropriate responses.
As part of this, we grouped ethnicity into the following categories: Asian, Caucasian, Jewish, Latin American, Middle Eastern, Mixed, and Other.
