\chapter{Terminology and notation}

As this paper is dealing with sandwich mathematics, which is a developing field, we will define the terms we have coined in this chapter.

\begin{description}
	\item[Sandwich question] A sandwich question is any question asked about sandwiches or their ingredients. We asked 43 sandwich questions as a part of this study. Participants answered each question on a 0 to 10 scale. We purposely started the scale at 0 so as to make 5 exactly in the middle of the range of possible responses.
