\chapter{Models}

We will use two models to analyze the relationship between purity and orthodoxy.

The first model we will use is a linear model.
This allows us to see the general trend of the correlation.

The second model we will use is a quadratic model.
This allows us to see more detailed results of how sandwich purity and sandwich orthodoxy are intertwined.

As we will see when we begin applying these two models in \vref{chap:outliers}, the quadratic model is significantly more accurate overall.
However, the linear model is useful for analyzing responses that do not significantly differ from the norm.
The linear model also shows whether the correlation between purity and orthodoxy is positive or negative.
