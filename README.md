Most images cited in the report are licensed under Creative Commons or are in the public domain. Unfortunately, not all images could be found under an acceptable license.
As such, we decided not to directly redistribute them here. However, all the images can be found at the URLs cited in the bibliography.
The one exception to this is the brick sandwich image, which we created by combining a CC-BY-SA 4.0 image of a brick with a public domain image of two slices of bread.
This image was included in the repository because it cannot be found elsewhere online.
